# Addon (WIP)

An example Heroku addon written in Golang

## Why use this?

Heroku gives a ton of documentation throughout their site, but I couldn't find a good end-to-end example of creating a custom Heroku addon that can then be published into their Marketplace. I wanted this to cover all parts of the addon from the provisioning and SSO endpoints to the actual table creation and database model.

## Assumptions

  - Using a PostgreSQL database as a datastore

## Current Status

This is a WIP. Will update with specs and more installation instructions once it is complete.
