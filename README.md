# Addon (WIP)

An example Heroku addon written in Golang

## Why use this?

Heroku gives a ton of documentation throughout their site, but I couldn't find a good end-to-end example of creating a custom Heroku addon that can then be published into their Marketplace. I want to encompass all parts of the addon from the provisioning and SSO to the actual table creation.

## Current Status

This is a WIP. Will update with specs and more installation instructions once it is complete.
